        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        The Linode API is an HTTP service that follows (to a large extent)
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>
        style. Resources (like Linodes) have predictable, sane URLs that use standard
        HTTP methods to manipulate and return standard HTTP status codes to tell you how
        it went.
        </p>
        <p>
        All API endpoints (starting from version 2) are located at
        <code>https://{{ site.api_root }}/{{ site.api_version }}/*</code>. Occasionally we will add
        features and improvements to our API - only certain changes will trigger a
        version bump:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Endpoint path changes</li>
            <li>JSON properties removed or changed</li>
            <li>Core changes (authentication, RESTful principles, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Notably, the addition of new API endpoints and new properties on JSON blobs does
        not imply a new version number.

        The API expoeses <strong>resources</strong> through various HTTP endpoints.
        You work with these resources through consistent use of HTTP verbs and
        a consistent tree of endpoints. The schema for the various resources
        available is documented in the <a href="#objects">objects</a> section.
        </p>
        <h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
        <p>
        Some API endpoints require authentication to use (this is indicated with
        <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Authenticated</span>
        throughout the documentation). To authenciated on behalf of a user, you
        need to use OAuth. The basic idea is that you can create <em>applications</em>
        that integrate with Linode, and register those applications with us. You
        can then direct users to our site and tell us what kind of permissions
        you'd like to have with their account. The user logs in and we redirect
        them back to you with a code that you may exchange for an <em>OAuth token</em>.
        This token can then be used to authenciate API requests on behalf of
        that user.
        </p>
        <p>
        Register your application <a href="https://{{ site.login_root }}/apps">here</a>.
        We'll provide you with a <em>client ID</em> and a <em>client secret</em>.
        You'll have to keep the client secret to yourself, but the client ID can
        be shared. When you want a user to log into your service, you can direct
        them to a URL like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>https://{{ site.login_root }}/oauth/authorize?client_id=<strong>client_id</strong></code></pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row reference">
    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify left">
        <h5>OAuth Scopes</h5>
        <p>
        Replace the client_id with your own. This login flow will give you the
        minimum access to a user's account, which just allows you to see their
        username and email address. If you want more access, you need to add
        <em>OAuth scopes</em> to the query string. An OAuth scope defines the
        scope of access your OAuth token will receive. You can request a comma-delimited
        list of scopes by adding <code>scopes=a,b,c</code> to the query
        string of the {{ site.login_root }} URL. A scope takes the form of <code>resource:access</code>,
        where "resource" is a protected resource and "access" is the level of access
        you will be granted on that resource. Access may be granted to "view", "modify",
        "create", or "delete" resources. In addition to the access you request,
        you will be granted each access level below it - for example, requesting
        "modify" access will also grant you "view" access, and requesting "delete"
        access will grant you full access to that resource (<code>resource:*</code>
        has the same effect).
        </p>
        <p>
        Each API endpoint documented on this page includes the OAuth scope necessary
        to use that resource, like this:
        <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-key"></i> linodes:view</span>.
        You may also request <code>*</code> to get full access to a user's account,
        but this is discouraged.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 right">
        <p>You can include the following parameters in the query string when
        you direct your users to {{ site.login_root }}:</p>

                        the redirect URI you registered your application
                        with should match the start of this string. If you
                        registered your app with http://example.org as the redirect
                        URI, then this parameter must start with "http://example.org".</td>

                    <td>state</td>

        <h5>Access Token</h5>
        <p>
        Once the user agrees to give your app the scopes you've requested, they
        will be redirected back to your application. If you provided a redirect_uri
        when you sent the user to {{ site.login_root }}, they will be redirected to that
        URI. Otherwise, the default redirect URI associated with your OAuth client
        will be used. When redirected, several paramters will be added to the query
        string: <code>code</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>email</code>,
        and <code>state</code>. The last parameter will match the state you
        gave us at the start of the flow (this allows you to ensure that the
        OAuth flow was initiated by your application, rather than by someone
        manually navigating to {{ site.login_root }} with your <code>client_id</code>).
        The username and email are just for convenience. The important
        parameter is the code - this is a code you can exchange for an OAuth
        token by making the following HTTP request:
        </p>
        <pre><code>POST https://{{ site.login_root }}/oauth/token</code></pre>
        <p>
        Make this request as <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> or
        as <code>multipart/form-data</code> and include the following paramters
        in the POST body:
        </p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal row">
            <dt class="col-sm-2">client_id</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Your app's client ID</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">client_secret</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Your app's client secret</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">code</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">The code you just received from the redirect</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
        You'll get a response like this:
        </p>
<pre><code>
{
  "scopes": "linodes:create",
  "access_token": "03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c"
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
        Note that we include the scopes here - in the future, we may change the
        login flow to allow the user to deny access to specific scopes. You
        should consider this list of scopes to be the list you have been granted
        and consider that it may be different than the ones you asked for. Also
        included is the actual <code>access_token</code>. With this token, you
        can proceed to make authenciated HTTP requests with the API by adding
        this header to each request:
        <code>Authorization: token 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c</code>.

        <h4 id="lists-and-objects">Lists &amp; Objects</h4>
        <p>
        There are generally two kinds of resources you can retrieve with a GET
        request - lists and objects. A list is a collection of objects, and each
        object has an ID and may be retrieved individually. You'll generally find
        lists of objects at <code>/object-name</code>, and the individual objects
        at <code>/object-name/object-id</code>. Some objects contain lists of other
        objects - you can get these at <code>/object-name/object-id/subobject-name</code>,
        and you can get an individual one at <code>/object-name/object-id/subobject-name/subobject-id</code>.
        For example, you can list your Linodes at <code>/linodes</code>, and get
        a specific Linode <code>/linodes/lino_1234</code>. You can get the configs
        for this Linode from <code>/linodes/lino_1234/configs</code>.
        </p>
        <h4 id="pagination">Pagination</h4>
        <p>
        Resource lists are always paginated. The response looks something like this:
        </p>
<pre><code>
{
    "linodes": [ ... ],
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 10,
    "total_results": 248
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Pages start at 1. Get a particular page by adding <code>?page=2</code>
        to your URL. Each page has 25 results.</p>
        <h4 id="editing-objects">Editing Objects</h4>
        <p>
        Some objects are editable, and each editable object may only have a
        handful of properties you may edit. the properties you may edit are
        indicated in the <a href="#objects">objects</a> section, with this
        indicator: <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Editable</span>.
        To edit these objects, you can perform a <code>PUT</code> request against
        the resource whose body is the updated JSON. You can omit any fields, or
        include fields you are not permitted to edit (changes to the latter
        will be ignored).
        In other words, if you <code>GET</code> a resource, you can change a
        property in the JSON that comes back and then PUT that JSON to the same
        URL to update it.
        </p>

<div class="row reference">
    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify left">
        <h4 id="errors">Errors</h4>
        <p>
            Success is indicated via
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">
                standard HTTP status codes
            </a>. Generally speaking, <code>2xx</code> codes indicate success,
            <code>4xx</code> codes indicate an error on your side, and
            <code>5xx</code> codes indicate an error on our side. An error on your
            side might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted, and
            so on. Errors on our side are not going to happen often and we're
            probably going to be running around with our hair on fire if you ever
            see them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every request that returns errors will look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
{
    "success": false,
    "errors": [
        {
            "field": "datacenter",
            "reason": "Record not found"
        }
    ]
}
        </pre>
        <p>
            The <code>success</code> field may not appear in requests that did
            not result in an error. The <code>errors</code> field is an array of
            the things that went wrong with your request. We will try to include
            as many of the problems in the response as possible, but it's
            possible that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in new
            errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the
            process of handling your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within each error object, the <code>field</code> parameter will be
            included if the error pertrains to a specific field in the JSON
            you've submitted. This will be omitted if there is no relevant
            field. The <code>reason</code> is a human-readable reason for the
            error, and will always be included.
