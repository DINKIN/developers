            The Linode API will return JSON objects to describe the various kinds of
            objects you can manage with it. These objects will always include an identifier,
            which will be a string used to reference that object.  These identifiers,
            called "labels," are returned in the "id" attribute.
        </p>

            Generally speaking, you may submit objects you receive through GET requests
            to the same endpoint you received them from, with a PUT request, to edit
            details of that object. Not all properties are editable, see the reference
            for each object type for a list of editable properties.
