        The API expoeses <strong>resources</strong> through various HTTP endpoints.
        You work with these resources through consistent use of HTTP verbs and
        a consistent tree of endpoints. The schema for the various resources
        available is documented in the <a href="#objects">objects</a> section.
        </p>
        <h3>Lists and objects</h3>
        <p>
        There are generally two kinds of resources you can retrieve with a GET
        request - lists and objects. A list is a collection of objects, and each
        object has an ID and may be retrieved individually. You'll generally find
        lists of objects at <code>/object-name</code>, and the individual objects
        at <code>/object-name/object-id</code>. Some objects contain lists of other
        objects - you can get these at <code>/object-name/object-id/subobject-name</code>,
        and you can get an individual one at <code>/object-name/object-id/subobject-name/subobject-id</code>.
        For example, you can list your Linodes at <code>/linodes</code>, and get
        a specific Linode <code>/linodes/lino_1234</code>. You can get the configs
        for this Linode from <code>/linodes/lino_1234/configs</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>Pagination</h4>
        <p>
        Resource lists are always paginated. The response looks something like this:
        </p>
<pre>
{
    "linodes": [ ... ],
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 10,
    "total_results": 248
}
</pre>
        <p>Pages start at 1. Get a particular page by adding <code>?page=2</code>
        to your URL. Each page has 25 results.</p>
        <h3>Editing objects</h3>
        <p>
        Some objects are editable, and each editable object may only have a
        handful of properties you may edit. the properties you may edit are
        indicated in the <a href="#objects">objects</a> section, with this
        indicator: <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Editable</span>.
        To edit these objects, you can perform a <code>PUT</code> request against
        the resource whose body is the updated JSON. You can omit any fields, or
        include fields you are not permitted to edit (changes to the latter
        will be ignored).
        In other words, if you <code>GET</code> a resource, you can change a
        property in the JSON that comes back and then PUT that JSON to the same
        URL to update it.
